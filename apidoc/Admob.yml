    Allows for the display of AdMob in Titanium Android applications.

    Please note that if your androidManifest has screen support set to: android:anyDensity="false", any banner ads will 
    display too small on high density devices.
    It is not clear at this point if this is a bug with AdMob or Titanium.
    In any event, you will either need to NOT set your screen support -- or set android:anyDensity="true" and adjust your app layout accordingly

    ## Getting Started

    View the [Using Titanium Modules](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Using_Titanium_Modules) document 
    for instructions on getting started with using this module in your application.

    ## Android

    Please note that if your androidManifest has screen support set to: android:anyDensity="false", any banner ads will 
    display too small on high density devices.
    It is not clear at this point if this is a bug with AdMob or Titanium.
    In any event, you will either need to NOT set your screen support -- or set android:anyDensity="true" and adjust your app layout accordingly

    In order to use the module you would need to add the following tags in your tiapp.xml

      <android 
          xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
          <manifest>
            <application>
              <meta-data
                  android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
                  android:value="your-admob-application-id"/>
            </application>
          </manifest>
        </android>

    ### Requirements
