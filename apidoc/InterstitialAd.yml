    Starting from 4.4.0 this module now supports Interstitial ads for Android.
    Starting from 3.0.0 this module now supports Interstitial ads for iPhone & iPad.
    Interstitial ads are full screen ads that are usually shown between natural steps of an application's interface flow.
    For instance doing different tasks in your application or between reading different articles.

    For best user experience Interstitial ads should be loaded prior showing the to the user. Interstitial ad instances can
    be used for showing one ad per loading, but they can be used multiple times. A good way of reusing an Interstitial ad is
    to show an ad, load a new after it has been closed one, and await for the proper time to show the recently loaded.
